# Spotify-Smart-Playlist - Automatic Spotify Playlist Sorting

I find adding to playlist feature very tedious personally for new songs I listen to. Most of them can fit into predictable playlists. Sometimes I'm not even sure if that song I'm liking is already is in a good playlist or not.

This tool automatically sorts your newly liked Spotify songs into your existing playlists based on artist genres.

## Quick Setup

1. **Get Spotify API credentials:**
   - Create app at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Add redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/callback`
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

2. **Get access token:**
   ```bash
   python3 get_token.py
   # Follow authorization flow, paste the token
   export SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN='your_token_here'
   ```

3. **Analyze your playlists** (generates smart rules):
   ```bash
   python3 analyze_playlists.py
   # Creates 'generated_config.json' with genre-to-playlist mappings
   ```

4. **Run automatic sorting:**
   ```bash
   # First run - sets up baseline (marks existing songs as processed)
   python3 autolist_increment.py
   
   # Future runs - only processes new liked songs
   python3 autolist_increment.py
   ```

## How It Works

Scans your existing playlists to learn which genres go where

Creates automatic mappings (e.g., "garage rock" â†’ "rock" playlist)

Only processes newly liked songs, skips old ones

Uses partial genre matching for better coverage

## Files Created

- `generated_config.json` - Genre-to-playlist rules
- `processing_history.json` - Tracks processed songs
- `playlist_analysis.json` - Detailed analysis results

## Options

```bash
# Initialize with specific date
python3 autolist_increment.py --init date --date 2025-06-10

# Initialize with index (skip first N songs)
python3 autolist_increment.py --init index --index 1781
```

## Automation

Set up cron job for automatic processing:
```bash
# Every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/project && python3 autolist_increment.py
```

**Result**: New songs you like are automatically sorted into the right playlists without any manual work. yay!

[TODO]
Sorting based on song's actual audio characteristics. Using vectors and distance to find the best playlist match.
